        Our monitoring and evaluation services help you assess the progress of
        projects and ensure that the project goals are being met. We provide
        comprehensive M&E services that include Baseline Evaluations, Endline
        Evaluations, Ex Post Evaluations and Impact Evaluations. Through our
        experienced consultants, we collect, analyze and report on data to
        evaluate the performance of a project. This help the organization to
        identify areas for improvement and make informed decisions about how to
        adjust the program to meet its objectives. Our M&E consultants also work
        collaboratively with stakeholders to ensure that the project is meeting
        its objectives.
